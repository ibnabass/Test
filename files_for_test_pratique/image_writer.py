# Image Writer Example
#
# USE THIS EXAMPLE WITH A USD CARD! Reset the camera after recording to see the file.
#
# This example shows how to use the Image Writer object to record snapshots of what your
# OpenMV Cam sees for later analysis using the Image Reader object. Images written to disk
# by the Image Writer object are stored in a simple file format readable by your OpenMV Cam.
